The excel sheets contain the x, y, and z cooridnates for the center of mass obtained by spatially constrained spectral clustering as described in Craddock et al., (2012) along with the channel labels and a shortened form of the ROI label. A corresponding cc200 value is also listed which helps in comparision of ROIs and ROI labels across datasets.
