Machine Learning in NeuroImaging (MALINI) is a MATLAB-based toolbox used for feature extraction and disease classification using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data. 18 different popular classifiers are presented. With slight modifications, it can also be used for any classification problem using any set of features.
